                The Voynich Manuscript is one of the most perplexing and mysterious documents ever discovered. Named after Wilfrid Voynich, the Polish book dealer who acquired it in 1912, the manuscript is believed to date back to the 15th century. Its origin, authorship, and the meaning of its strange script and illustrations have puzzled historians, cryptographers, and linguists for centuries.
